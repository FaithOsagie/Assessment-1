AltSchool Africa Assessment 1

This is the solution of my first assessment from AltSchool Africa. this project is testing my knowledge of basic HTML structure, organization and formatting.
I had to work with things like semantic tags, the image tag, setting up the basic boilerplate for HTML5, list tags and the overall basics of HTML.
The task is to build any recipe page of my choice with HTML.
